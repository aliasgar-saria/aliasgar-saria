# Hi, I'm Aliasgar Saria (Ali) 👋

I'm an AI/ML Engineer and Data Scientist currently working on computer vision at ISI Kolkata IDEAS Technology Innovation Hub, focusing on understanding and processing Diabetic Eye Retinopathy (Eye Fundus images).

I specialize in building ML solutions with PyTorch and SLMs, Multimodal Vision, Agentic AI orchestration (Zapier, N8N), and edge computing. I also do Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis with SQL and Power BI.
