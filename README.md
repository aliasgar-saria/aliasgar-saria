# Hi, I'm Aliasgar Saria (Ali) 👋
I'm an AI/ML Engineer and a Data Scientist.

Currently working on computer vision at ISI Kolkata IDEAS Technology Innovation Hub, understanding and processing Diabetic Eye Retinopathy (Eye Fundus images)
I specialize in building AI solutions with PyTorch and SLMs, Statistical Analysis, Multimodal Vision, Agentic AI orchestration (Zapier, N8N), and edge computing. Learning Cuda and C++.
Earned my Master's in Data Science from Fergusson College with specialized training in Deep Learning from ISI Kolkata. 
Certified across Microsoft Azure (AI-102, DP-100, AZ-204, AZ-104), AWS (AIF-C01), and experienced in deploying production ML systems on cloud platforms. 
When I'm not coding, I'm learning business, cooking, travelling, exploring cultures and learning languages!

My Priorites:
Equitable & Ethical AI
Local &  xAI
Data Privacy and Cyber Security
Scalable Solution Building

Exploring opportunities to contribute in 2 sectors:
1, Healthcare Data Analysis and/or medical computer vision (Neurology/Cardiology/Mobility). Want to build something impactful, meaningful and which helps save lifes.
2. Physical AI, Digital Twins and Robotics. These are fascinating new developments.

### 🚧 GitHub Profile Under Development

**Note:** This GitHub is currently under construction! About 90% of my code has yet to be pushed here—most of my work lives locally or in private repos. Stay tuned as I gradually migrate and showcase my projects. Think of this as the trailer before the main show! 🎬
